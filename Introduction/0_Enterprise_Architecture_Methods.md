## Enterprise Architecture Methods

An architecture method is a structured collection of techniques and process steps for creating and maintaining an enterprise architecture.

Architecture methods typically display the various phases of architecture lifecycle, what deliverables should be produced at each stage and how they are verified or tested.
The architecture methods are basically the tools that are developped to control the architecture lifecycle and develop the enterprise architecture framework.

### Rational Unified Process (RUP)

The Rational Unified Process is an iterative software development process framework. It defines an iterative process, as opposed to the classical waterfall process, that realise software by adding functionality to the architecture at each increment.
